## Welcome to the Synth Programming Language Website!

You can use find the link to GitHub Repository [here](https://github.com/GabrielGonzalez30/Synth). This site is meant to explain the documentation of what our language does.


### Synth: Interactive Audio Processing Language

Built by:
 - Gabriel Gonzalez
 - Pedro Santiago
 - José Túa
 - Jaime Torrens

### Language Features

- Able to create, modify and store audio files (mp3, wav, etc) via sound synthesis and sound recording (called streams), as well as realtime playback of streams.
- Able to create & modify effects, add effects to different streams.
- Able to interface with MIDI controllers, as well as create a keyboard, soundboards, etc., using a computer keyboard


### Code Samples
```markdown
# Initializing Streams
_`InitStream s1 as Synthesizer`_
Intializes a stream of a Synthesizer instrument as any symbol, s1 in this case.

_`InitStream s183 as Synthesizer`_
Intializes a stream of a Synthesizer instrument as any symbol, s183 in this case.

**Initializing an existing stream will empty that existing stream and render it empty.**

# Adding Waves to Stream
**The following line will only happen if a Stream has been initialized.** 
**Otherwise, this cannot occur.**
1. _`As s1 setWave(Sine,600)`_
In the s1 stream, creates a Sine wave with a frequency of 600.

2. _`As s1 setWave(Sine)`_
In the s1 stream, creates a Sine wave with a default frequency of 200.

3. _`As s183 setWave(Saw)`_
In the s183 stream, creates a Saw wave with a default frequency of 200.

4. _`As s1 setWave(Square,250)`_
In the s1 stream, creates a Square wave with a frequency of 250.

# Changing Frequencies of Waves
1. _`As s1 setFrequency(100)`_
In the s1 stream, frequencies are changed to 100 as parameters imply.

# Playing Streams
**If no streams have been initialized, this will return an exception.**
**Streams must exist for this to work.**
1. _`play(s1)`_
Plays the s1 symbol waves stream.

#Pausing Streams
**If no streams have been initialized, this will return an exception.**
**Streams must exist for this to work.**
1. _`pause(s183)`_
Pauses the s1 symbol waves stream.

### Built With/Tools
- Implementation Languages: C++ (gcc for Unix, Visual C++ for Windows)
- Git and GitHub for source control
- Synthesis Toolkit
	- STK is a set of open source audio signal processing and algorithmic synthesis classes written in the C++ programming language.
	- The STK can be found [here](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/stk/).
